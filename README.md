# Tutedude Python Assignment 5 – Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python

This repository contains Python scripts developed for **Assignment 5** of the **Tutedude Python Programming Course**, based on **Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python**. The objective of this assignment is to explore essential Python data structures such as dictionaries and lists, along with fundamental operations like slicing and searching within collections.

The assignment is structured into two tasks. **Task 1** focuses on dictionary creation and retrieval operations. The program builds a dictionary where student names are used as keys and their respective marks as values. It then prompts the user to enter a student's name and attempts to fetch the corresponding marks. If the student exists in the dictionary, the program displays their marks; otherwise, it shows an appropriate message indicating that the student was not found. This task reinforces the concept of key-value mapping and conditional access in dictionaries, which are a core component of Python data handling.

**Task 2** demonstrates the concept of list slicing and manipulation. The program first creates a list containing numbers from 1 to 10. It then extracts the first five elements using slicing, reverses this subset, and prints both the sliced list and the reversed version. This task provides hands-on experience with Python’s versatile list operations and introduces students to efficient ways of accessing and modifying list elements using slicing syntax and built-in methods.

All scripts are implemented using Python 3 and follow clean coding practices to ensure clarity and simplicity. User-friendly prompts and result messages are included, along with necessary checks to handle possible edge cases such as missing dictionary entries. These exercises build practical experience with Python’s built-in data structures and serve as a strong foundation for more advanced programming concepts.

To run the programs, simply clone this repository and execute the `.py` files in a Python 3 environment. This assignment demonstrates the practical application of collections and string operations, which are critical skills in any Python developer’s toolkit.
